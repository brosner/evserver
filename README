INSTALLATION

You should probably check out current development brach:
$ svn checkout http://evserver.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ evserver

Then, to use 'evserver' you just need to set your PYTHONPATH environment
variable, for example, if you have evserver sources installed in your home directory:
$ PYTHONPATH="$HOME/evserver" python ./myscript.py

If you must have egg package, you can get one:
$ wget ""
$ sudo easy_install evserver

But beware, this packet has included a libevent.so binary, which is 32 bits only.


COMPILATION

This package needs libevent.so binary and automatically generated python wrapper
file for this specific version of libevent. Currently I include libevent 1.4.5
32 bit files. If you need to use your own version of libevent, you must:
  - install dependencies:
    $ sudo apt-get install gccxml python-setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install ctypeslib

  - grab libevent sources. Libevent from 1.4.2 to 1.4.5 seems to be working. 1.4.1 had
    an important bug in chunk encoding, 1.4.6 and newer have issues when receiving
    timeouts on file descriptors. I use libevent-1.4.5.
    You need to compile the sources.
    $ wget "http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent-1.4.5-stable.tar.gz"
    $ tar xvzf libevent-1.4.5-stable.tar.gz
    $ cd libevent-1.4.5
    $ ./configure && make

 - Run 'make ctypes' with LIBEVENTSOURCES environment variable set, for example:
    $ LIBEVENTSOURCES=../libevent-1.4.5-stable make ctypes
   Then, if you need to create egg, just run 'make egg'
    $ LIBEVENTSOURCES=../libevent-1.4.5-stable make egg
   Your package will be ready in 'dist' directory.


RUNNING

If you installed egg just try:
 $ evserver

If you haven't installed egg, only got the development branch in ~/evserver:
 $ ~/evserver/evserver.py


TESTS

There are some working tests for the application. You can run them:
 $ make test


FEATURES

The status panel is great. Just add '-s 127.0.0.1:9999' option when running eveserver,
and see the status at url http://127.0.0.1:9999/




BUGS

 There are still some issues with this software:
 - Despite long fight, there are still some memory leaks in libevent. The leaks are tiny, but take
   them into consideration and think of restarting the worker processes once in few months.
 -


I FOUND A BUG!
 That's great! It means that I'm still a human (I lost my certainty about this point).
 Write a test case using our 'test.py' facility, then I'll try to fix a bug for free.
 In the other case feel free to fix the bug yourself, I'd be happy to include your
 changes. Just drop me the patch at majek04+evserver@gmail.com
